This 220,000 sf  project is a new engineering building for NC State University, housing the dean of the college of engineering, the civil engineering department, and the structural engineering department. It includes research labs, teaching labs, classrooms, and offices. I was involved from the programming phase through closeout. During Programming,  I developed a database to track and validate programming requirements throughout the design process. In the design phase,  computational design was used to calculate daylighting, energy usage, a dynamic window layout on the exterior.  Computational tools were also used to create the focal point for the interior of the building, a wood wall and metal stair meant to visually draw people up into the building. The wood wall was made up of a  series of 50 unique, 4-sided faceted panels arranged into large repeating triangles, the form inspired by blending the work of  both departments. Since computational design was used, each panel was repeated up to 8 times each allowing for design intent and budget constraints to be met. The resulting design was sent digitally as a series of coordinate points to the fabricator to be digitally fabricated. As the main Architectural representative on the project during CA, the data from the contractor was linked to a floor plan to quickly illustrate where the design team needed to work that day. My scope of work also included me being the LEED accredited professional helping the project achieve LEED Silver, and the first LEED v4 project for our company.

	  <p>Architect | Facade Detailing, Grasshopper Scripting, Revit Architecture Lead</p>
	  <p>
The Wake Tech campus is split by a natural wetland and forest. The site for the deck is located directly on one edge of the forest. All students commute to campus, requiring ample parking and large parking decks. To break up the monotony of the long edge of the deck, a parametrically generated stainless steel facade was designed. The panels respond to its context by being closely spaced at the street edge and opening up at the wetland edge as they turn the corner. Both sides of the deck are visible to students, one side is visible from the street, and the other from a pedestrian bridge that moves across the wetlands and connects to the main library of the campus. In addition, a computational design for supergraphic floor numbers was generated out of durable ACM panels.

	  <p>The new engineering library for NC State has won over 20 design awards and been featured in multiple publications. My engagement started during  Schematic Design. As BIM Coordinator I was responsible for ensuring the Revit model was working properly. I was also responsible for a large part of the documentation alongside the team. I also was responsible for reviewing RFI's, Site visits, and ASI's. During CA I created a database that tracked all the CA Documents. The database was such a success that it was deployed firm-wide for all projects in CA.</p>

	  <p>Duke University needed to increase the desirability of the Edens Quad dorms. Students simply didn't want to stay in the closed off, Brutalist quad that turned its back on the rest of campus. The University also wanted the dorms to feel more open, inviting and connected to the rest of the campus. The big idea we had was to collect all the small shared commons spaces that were spread throughout the dorms and gather them into one place (replacing the existing spaces with dorm rooms). The final idea included slicing a hole through one of the buildings to act as the gateway to the quad, making it more inviting. This gateway houses the new study commons and gaming room. Other parts of the renovation included reworking the outdoor spaces to be more inviting and usable, renovation of each dorm's commons rooms by removing the solid concrete panels and replacing them with glass, as well as the addition of amenities such as a Gym.</p>
