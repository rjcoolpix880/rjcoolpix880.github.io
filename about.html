		<h3>Projects</h3>
		<br><br>
		Ryan elevates architectural craft by utilizing computational methodologies to realize complex design visions that traditional practice often deems unbuildable. By bridging the gap between digital intent and physical fabrication, he ensures that high-design concepts survive the rigors of budget constraints and construction logistics to become award-winning realities.
		<br><br>
		At the Madera Cyber Innovation Center, the design team faced a conflict between a complex "tour-de-force" spiral stair and rigid fabrication constraints. Ryan led a computational strategy that rationalized the form, allowing the design to remain the building's centerpiece. This approach did not just solve a geometric problem; it re-established the architect as the master builder, delivering a turnkey solution to fabricators that preserved the project's artistic integrity and contributed to its 2025 AIA Aspire Honor Award.
		<br><br>
		This methodology transforms cost barriers into design opportunities. For the Wake Tech Parking Deck, when budget cuts threatened the project's identity, Ryan’s parametric approach allowed the team to completely reimagine the facade’s material application without sacrificing the dynamic aesthetic. His work proves that advanced technology is not merely an efficiency tool, but a vital instrument for advocating for design quality, enabling architects to deliver superior built environments within standard delivery models.

		<h3>Practice</h3>
		<br><br>
		Innovation in architecture often fails due to a lack of structure. Ryan advances the practice of architecture by developing scalable frameworks that allow firms to adopt emerging technologies safely and effectively. His work shifts the industry paradigm from ad-hoc experimentation to strategic, data-driven implementation.
		<br><br>
		Recognizing that data is an underutilized asset in design, Ryan operationalized quality assurance processes at a firm-wide scale. By developing custom database workflows for the James B. Hunt Jr. Library and Fitts-Woolard Hall, he demonstrated how data validation protects the firm from risk and ensures programming compliance. These systems moved beyond project-specific tools to become standard operating procedures for complex delivery.
		<br><br>
		Currently, Ryan is defining the roadmap for the future of practice through AI Governance. Moving the profession past the initial hype, he developed a comprehensive AI Strategy that categorizes tools by risk and utility. His creation of firm-wide "AI Toolkits" and ethical guidelines serves as a model for the industry, demonstrating how large practices can harness the power of artificial intelligence to augment human creativity while maintaining professional rigor and liability standards.

		<h3>Industry</h3>
		<br><br>
		A "Digital Divide" threatens to fragment the profession, separating those who understand computation from those who do not. Ryan acts as a bridge, translating complex technological concepts into accessible strategies for the broader AIA membership. His advocacy ensures that technology remains a tool for all architects, not just specialists.
		<br><br>
		As the Chair of the AIA Technology in Architectural Practice (TAP) Knowledge Community, Ryan steered national dialogue during a critical era of digital transition. He championed a "people-first" approach to technology, curating resources and awards programs that prioritized architectural outcome over digital novelty. His leadership provided thousands of members with the clarity needed to navigate an increasingly complex software landscape.
		<br><br>
		Ryan continuously feeds his expertise back into the profession through prolific teaching and writing. Through lectures at universities and industry forums, and articles such as "Monumental Stairs: How Computational Design Guided Collaboration," he demystifies the "black box" of computation. By openly sharing his workflows and strategies, he empowers a new generation of architects to leverage technology with confidence, securing the profession’s relevance in a digital future.
