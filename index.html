	  <h2>Wake Tech : Parking Deck 2</h2>
	  <p>2008-2009</p>
	  <p>850 space Parking Deck</p>
	  <p>Architect | Facade Detailing, Grasshopper Scripting, Revit Architecture Lead </p>
	  <p>The Wake Tech campus is split by a natural wetland and forest. The site for the deck is located directly on one edge of the forest. All student commute to campus requiring ample parking. The result of this was a deck that is proportionally long and used frequently. To break up the monotony of the long edge, a parametrically generated stainless steel facade was designed. The panels respond to the street edge by being closely spaced, and the wetland edge by opening up as the turn the corner. Both sides of the deck are visible by students, one side is visible from the street, and the other by a pedestrian bridge that moves across the wetlands and connects to the main library of the campus. </p>

	  <h2>NC State : James B Hunt Jr Library</h2>
	  <p>2009-2012</p>
	  <p>230,000 sqft Engineering Library</p>
	  <p>Intern Architect</p>
	  <p> This library was originally conceived to put NC State University on the nation stage. It has won over 20 design awards and featured in multiple publications. The building is such a success that the library has full time staff that are devoted to giving tours of the building. My firm worked with the lead design architect Snohetta. My role included heavy involvement from Schematic Design on. I was the BIM Coordinator and responsible for making sure that the Revit model was working properly, as well as doing a large part of the documentation alongside the team. My role continued into Construction Administration as I was responsible for reviewing RFI's, Site visits, and ASI's. During CA, i created a database that tracked all the CA Documents that was used by the entire team with so much success, that it was deployed firm-wide for all of our projects in CA</p>

	  <h2>Duke University: Edens Quad Dorm Renovation</h2>
	  <p>2014-2015</p>
	  <p>154,000 sqft Dorm Renovation</p>
	  <p>Architect</p>
	  <p>Duke university wanted to increase the desirability of the Edens Quad dorms. Students simply didn't want to stay in the closed off Brutilist quad that turned its back on the rest of campus. The University also wanted the dorms to feel more open, inviting and connected to the rest of the campus. The big idea was to gather up all the small shared commons spaces that were spread throughout the dorms and collect them into one place (infilling them with dorm rooms). The final idea included cutting a hole through one of the buildings to act as the gateway to the quad, making it more inviting. It also was the location where the new study commons and gaming room was relocated. Other parts of the renovation included reworking the outdoor spaces to be more inviting and usable, renovation of each dorms commons rooms by removing the Brutalist concrete panels and replacing them with glass, and the addition of amenities such as a Gym.</p>

	  <p>2014-2015</p>
	  <p>Architect. Facade Detailing, and Coordination.</p>
		<p>This project is the location for emergency services for the City of Raleigh. It is in operation 24-7 and also is the location where the city is operated in times of emergency. Unique elements are that the building is in compliance with DOD blast and bulletproof requirements. Our firm was responsible for the design of the Exterior Skin, and the initial layout concepts of the building. I was responsible for the thermally broken brick lintel detail that involved pulling the lintel off the facade, so that the insulation could be continuous behind the steel. A company first.</p>

	<div class="col-third container">
	<p> Technology and how it can impact Design is one of my main passions. Out of this, I created and lead the Tech Studio inside Clark Nexsen, which is a multi-disciplinary firm of nearly 400 people. I am responsible for fostering and sharing ideas surrounding technology in our firm. The group consists of around 30 people in various disciplines with various roles in the firm. I regularly create presentation for the monthly meetings, as well as presentations to the Shareholders, and the Board of Directors.</p>

	  <h2>Pebble Smart-watch App</h2>
	  <p>I like minimal watch faces on my Pebble Smart-watch. The issue with these is they do not show the date, and the pebble OS didn't have an easy way to just show the date. So I hacked together some code and created an app for the Pebble Appstore that does just that. It shoes the date when you hit one of the buttons on the side of the watch. Various visual aspects of the app are customizable through your smart phone<p>

	 <h2>Who We Are: Javascript image</h2>
	 <p> I created a Script that took employee data from out employee database and images from our image database and created a graphic of the faces of our entire firm. At the time, our firm was trying to feel more like one cohesive firm, and people found it fun to try to find themselves in the image. The script allowed for customization of the order and color border by Office location, or the discipline they represented.

	 <h2>Intranet Restructuring</h2>
	 <p> I was involved on a small team to take our companies Intranet and improve it. The old intranet was confusing, unregulated, and all the information was old. Our group took the existing intranet and pared it down immensely, so that it was easier to find what was needed as well as a easier place to share knowledge. The result is more engagement across the firm, the information in the libraries is more relevant, staff know where find information, and who to contact if things are outdated or missing. Our group is still involved in encouraging people to post and contribute to the intranet.As a result, the amount of posts, content, and most importantly quality has increased. Our firm was asked to present our redesign to at a conference put on by Knowledge Architecture.</p>

	 <h2>CANstruction</h2>
	 <p>I created a Grasshopper script to rapidly visualize and iterate the design for the CANStruction fund raising event. We partnered with RedHat, a tech company, so I thought that we should try to implement as much technology as possible. The script allowed for a form and can heights to be input and then it would generate a visualization of the final result including can count. After the design was completed and sent to the CNC fabricator, the quote was too high because it was slightly wider than the material provided. A quick reduction in the size of the underlaying form generated a new output that used 21 less sheets and saved over $1000 in labor. Without parametric scripting the entire drawings would have had to be redone.</p>
	 <p>There is a article that I wrote for Clark Nexsen's website that will be posted soon</p>
