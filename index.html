	  <h2>Wake Tech : Parking Deck 2</h2>
	  <p>2008-2009</p>
	  <p>850 space Parking Deck</p>
	  <p><a href="http://www.clarknexsen.com/project/parking-deck/" target="_blank">Clark Nexsen Project Page</a></p>

	  <p>Architect | Facade Detailing, Grasshopper Scripting, Revit Architecture Lead</p>
	  <p>The Wake Tech campus is split by a natural wetland and forest. The site for the deck is located directly on one edge of the forest. All students commute to campus, requiring ample parking. Thus the need for a deck that is proportionally long and used frequently. To break up the monotony of the long edge, a parametrically generated stainless steel facade was designed. The panels respond to the street edge by being closely spaced, and the wetland edge by opening up as they turn the corner. Both sides of the deck are visible to students, one side is visible from the street, and the other from a pedestrian bridge that moves across the wetlands and connects to the main library of the campus. </p>

	  <p><a href="http://www.clarknexsen.com/project/james-b-hunt-jr-library/" target="_blank">Clark Nexsen Project Page</a></p>

	  <p>This library was originally conceived to put NC State University on the national stage. It has won over 20 design awards and been featured in multiple publications. The building is such a success that the library has full time staff devoted to giving tours of the building. My firm worked with the lead design architect Snohetta. I was heavily involved in this project beginning with Schematic Design. As BIM Coordinator I was responsible ensuring the Revit model was working properly. I was also responsible for a large part of the documentation alongside the team. My role continued into Construction Administration as I was responsible for reviewing RFI's, Site visits, and ASI's. During CA, I created a database that tracked all the CA Documents. The database was such a success that it was deployed firm-wide for all projects in CA.</p>

	  <h2>Duke University: Edens Quad Dorm Renovation</h2>
	  <p>2014-2015</p>
	  <p>2017 AIA NC Honor Award</p>
	  <p>154,000 sqft Dorm Renovation</p>
	  <p>Architect</p>
	  <p><a href="http://www.clarknexsen.com/project/edens-quad-renovation/" target="_blank">Clark Nexsen Project Page</a></p>

	  <p>Duke University needed to increase the desirability of the Edens Quad dorms. Students simply didn't want to stay in the closed off, Brutalist quad that turned its back on the rest of campus. The University also wanted the dorms to feel more open, inviting and connected to the rest of the campus. The big idea we had was to collect all the small shared commons spaces that were spread throughout the dorms and gather them into one place (replacing the existing spaces with dorm rooms). The final idea included slicing a hole through one of the buildings to act as the gateway to the quad, making it more inviting. This gateway houses the new study commons and gaming room. Other parts of the renovation included reworking the outdoor spaces to be more inviting and usable, renovation of each dorm's commons rooms by removing the solid concrete panels and replacing them with glass, as well as the addition of amenities such as a Gym.</p>

	  <p>Architect | Facade Detailing, and Coordination.</p>
	  <p><a href="http://www.clarknexsen.com/project/central-communications-center/" target="_blank">Clark Nexsen Project Page</a></p>

		<p>This project is the location for the City of Raleigh emergency services. It is in operation 24-7 and is also the location for city operations in times of emergency. The building has unique elements such as its compliance with DOD blast and bulletproof requirements. Our firm was responsible for the design of initial schematic and final design and detailing the Exterior Skin. Prompted by a research article I found, I suggested the idea for the thermally broken brick lintel detail to improve the R value for the wall. This involved pulling the lintel off the facade so that the insulation could be continuous behind the steel. This detail was a company first.</p>

	  <h2>Daylighting and Energy Modeling</h2>
	  <p>During design of the Engineering Building at NC State University, I developed a tool to help determine loads and daylighting for a typical office. There are nearly 200 8ft x 16ft  offices on the perimeter of the building. Working alongside Mechanical and Electrical engineers we determined a set of criteria for analyzing options. We established that the chilled beam sizes were a good, tangible,  threshold for determining the value of each iteration. We focused on reducing the peak load to get down to certain thresholds of chilled beams via WWR, Glass types (SHGC), and Shading. The original Mechanical engineers calculation required more than one 2ft x 6ft chilled beam in each office. Using the tool we were able to come up with an acceptable option that could reduce the load down to only requiring one 2ft x 2ft chilled beam in the office. </p>

	  <h2>Pebble Smart-watch App</h2>
	  <p>I like minimal watch faces on my Pebble Smart-watch. The issue with these is they do not show the date and the pebble OS didn't have an easy way to simply show the date. I hacked together some code and created an app for the Pebble Appstore that does just that. It shoes the date when you hit one of the buttons on the side of the watch. Various visual aspects of the app are customizable through your smart phone<p>

	 <h2>Intranet Restructuring</h2>
	 <p>I was involved with a small team to improve our company's Intranet. The previous Intranet was confusing, unregulated and all the information was outdated. Our group took the existing Intranet and pared it down immensely. It became easier to find what was needed as well as an easier place to share knowledge. The result is more engagement across the firm, the information in the libraries is more relevant, staff know where find information, as well as who to contact if things are outdated or missing. Our group is still involved in encouraging people to post and contribute to the Intranet. As a result, the amount of posts, content, and most importantly, the quality have all increased. Our firm was asked to present our redesign to at a conference put on by Knowledge Architecture.</p>

	 <h2>CANstruction</h2>
	 <p>I created a Grasshopper script to rapidly visualize and iterate the design for the CANStruction fund raising event. We partnered with RedHat, a tech company, so I wanted to implement as much technology as possible. The script allowed for the form and can heights to be input and it would then generate a visualization of the final result including can count. After the design was completed and sent to the CNC fabricator, the quote was too high because it was slightly wider than the material provided. A quick reduction in the size of the underlying form generated a new output that used 21 less sheets and saved over $1,000 in labor. Without parametric scripting the entire drawings would have had to be redone.</p>
