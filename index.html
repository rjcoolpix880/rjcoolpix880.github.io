	  <h2>Pebble Smartwatch App</h2>
	  <p>I like minimal watchfaces on my Pebble Smartwatch. The issue with these is they do not show the date, and the pebble OS didnt have an easy way to just show the date. So I hacked together some code and created an app for the Pebble Appstore that does just that. It shoes the date when you hit one of the buttons on the side of the watch. Various aspects are customizable through your smartphone<p>

The script allowed for custimnization of the order and color border by Office location, or the discipline they reporesented.

	 <h2>Intranet Restructuring</h2>
	 <p> I was invoilved on a small team to take out companies Intranet and improve it. The old intranet was confusion, unregulated, and all the informatiuon was old. Our group took the intranet and pared it down immensly, so taht it was easier to find what you eneded as well as a easier place to share knowledge. The result seems like there is more ingagement in the intranet, the inforamtion in the librariues is more relivant, and staff know where who to contact if things are outdated or old. Our group is still involved in encouraging people to post certain things to the intranet, adn the quality and amount of posts and content has increased. Our firm was asked to present our redesign to at a conference put on by Knowledge Artchitecture.</p>
