	  <h3>USAFA Cyberworks</h3>
	  <p>The client requested a spiral staircase with glass railings, but due to the size and height of the space, the staircase needed to be a freeform shape rather than a traditional spiral. By using computational design, I was able to ensure that the structure of the staircase and the requirements for safety and building codes were all properly met. All while maintaining the requirements for fabrication of the bent glass needed for the railings.</p>

	  <h5>AIA TAP National Advisory Group   2020 Chair</h5>
	  <p>2017-2022. I serve on the leadership group for the AIA Technology in Architectural Practice Knowledge Community (TAP). Responsibilities include charing the 2020 Building Connections Congress confrerence and the 2021 national AIA Innovation awards. Other involvement includes advising the AIA Strategic Council, and serving on various taskforces such as the national AIA COVID-19 task force. TAP serves as a resource for AIA members, the profession, and the public in the deployment of computer technology in the practice of architecture. Technology in Architectural Practice monitors the development of computer technology and its impact on architecture practice and the entire building life cycle, including design, construction, facility management, and retirement or reuse. </p>

	  <h5>Daylighting and Energy Modeling</h5>
	  <p>During design of the Engineering Building at NC State University, I developed a tool to help determine loads and daylighting for a typical office. There are nearly 200 8ft x 16ft  offices on the perimeter of the building. Working alongside Mechanical and Electrical engineers we determined a set of criteria for analyzing options. We established that the chilled beam sizes were a good, tangible,  threshold for determining the value of each iteration. We focused on reducing the peak load to get down to certain thresholds of chilled beams via WWR, Glass types (SHGC), and Shading. The original Mechanical engineers calculation required more than one 2ft x 6ft chilled beam in each office. Using the tool we were able to come up with an acceptable option that could reduce the load down to only requiring one 2ft x 2ft chilled beam in the office. </p>

	  <h5>Pebble Smart-watch App</h5>
	  <p>I like minimal watch faces on my Pebble Smart-watch. The issue with these is they do not show the date and the pebble OS didn't have an easy way to simply show the date. I hacked together some code and created an app for the Pebble Appstore that does just that. It shoes the date when you hit one of the buttons on the side of the watch. Various visual aspects of the app are customizable through your smart phone<p>

	 <h5>Who We Are: Javascript image</h5>
	 <p> I created a Script that took employee data from our employee database and images from our image database and created a graphic of the faces of our entire firm. At the time of it's creation, our multi-office firm was attempting to feel more cohesive and people also found it fun to try to find themselves in the image. The script allows for a strong amount of customization such as the order of images and color borders representing office location or discipline.</p>

	 <h5>Intranet Restructuring</h5>
	 <p>I was involved with a small team to improve our company's Intranet. The previous Intranet was confusing, unregulated and all the information was outdated. Our group took the existing Intranet and pared it down immensely. It became easier to find what was needed as well as an easier place to share knowledge. The result is more engagement across the firm, the information in the libraries is more relevant, staff know where find information, as well as who to contact if things are outdated or missing. Our group is still involved in encouraging people to post and contribute to the Intranet. As a result, the amount of posts, content, and most importantly, the quality have all increased. Our firm was asked to present our redesign to at a conference put on by Knowledge Architecture.</p>

	 <h5>CANstruction</h5>
	 <p>I created a Grasshopper script to rapidly visualize and iterate the design for the CANStruction fund raising event. We partnered with RedHat, a tech company, so I wanted to implement as much technology as possible. The script allowed for the form and can heights to be input and it would then generate a visualization of the final result including can count. After the design was completed and sent to the CNC fabricator, the quote was too high because it was slightly wider than the material provided. A quick reduction in the size of the underlying form generated a new output that used 21 less sheets and saved over $1,000 in labor. Without parametric scripting the entire drawings would have had to be redone.</p>
