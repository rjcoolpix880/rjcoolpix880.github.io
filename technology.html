					 <h3>3D Wood Wall</h3>
					<br>
					 <a href="https://rjcoolpix880.github.io/architecture.html#6169">Link to Architecture page</a>
					  <p>This 220,000 sf  project is a new engineering building for NC State University, housing the dean of the college of engineering, the civil engineering department, and the structural engineering department. It includes research labs, teaching labs, classrooms, and offices. Computational tools were used to create the focal point for the interior of the building, 2 wood walls at the entrances with the biggest spanning 4 floors measuring 86’ by 50’  meant to visually draw people up into the building. Inspired by the work of  the departments, images from their research were used to create the underlying form.The form  generated the 50, 4-sided flat panels that were  arranged into large repeating triangles. Aggressive cost targets were met by repeating each panel at least 6 times and not exceeding a maximum panel size. The resulting design was digitally transmitted to the fabricator for production.

					 <h3>Monumental Stairs</h3>
						<p>I created a computational approach for moving geometry between the design softwares for the design of the monumental stairs at Fitts-Woolard hall. There are 5 unique sets of stairs, all configured differently, bending to maximize the penetration of the sunlight from the skylight at the top of each run.  The engineer used the traditional workflow of manually modeling for 2 of the stairs and the computational approach for the remaining 3.   The engineer stated that the new process saved around a day of time for the more simple stairs, and around 3 days of time for the winding stair. An estimated 7 days of time would have been saved if the process was used on all 5 stairs. Later on it was even identified that one of the manually input stairs offset the members on the wrong side of the reference line, resulting in a stair that was 6” too narrow and needed to be fixed.

					 <h3>Misc</h3>
						<p> For Fitts-Woolard Hall I was involved from the programming phase through closeout and ustilized comutational thinking throught to improve processes and the design. During Programming,  I developed a database to track and validate programming requirements throughout the design process. In the design phase,  computational design was used to calculate daylighting, energy usage, and a dynamic window layout on the exterior. As the main Architectural representative on the project, during CA the data from the contractor was linked to a floor plan to quickly illustrate where the design team needed to work that day. My scope of work also included me being the LEED accredited professional helping the project achieve LEED Silver, and the first LEED v4 project for our company.

				 <h3>Freeform Stair</h3>
				 <p>Under Construction<br>
				 	A new classroom building in Colorado provides opportunities for the students in the Academy.  Cyberworx  prioritize the needs of military personnel, think about complex systems, and use new technologies like AI, AR, IoT, and quantum computing to make the Air Force and Department of Defense more effective and efficient. My involvement is isolated to  the freeform stair that is located in the entrance atrium. The owner wanted a spiral stair to fit in with the context of other buildings on campus that have similar stairs. However due to the shape of the opening a spiral stair could not fit and computational tools were required to make the geometry of the stair work with the curved glass railings. Working closely with structural engineer and the glass bending company, a freeform stair was designed that meets all code, fabrication, and structural requirements. Work also included providing digital 3D models to the fabricator for direct fabrication of formwork.

				 	<h5>Wake Tech Parking Deck</h5>
					 <h3>Stainless steel facade panels</h3>
					 <a href="https://rjcoolpix880.github.io/architecture.html#1648">Link to Architecture page</a>
					 <p>The Wake Tech campus is split by a natural wetland and forest. The site for the deck is located directly on one edge of the forest. All students commute to campus, requiring ample parking and large parking decks. For this project, the facade is 350 feet long so the traditional ideas were not working for the design team. The idea was to create a textured pattern on the facade that would reflect and respond to the site. The team liked the idea of creating panels that reflected the surroundings at different angles to create a dynamic appearance as you drove along the deck. The resulting design arranged panels  in a way that created a texture by only varying the panel spacing and the panel orientation. The script first generated a single panel profile that could be bent from a roll of stainless steel. These panels could then be rotated 180 degrees to add to the desired texture. The design bid under budget, however the owner wanted the facade budget cut in half. Fortunately since the design was done using computational tools, we quickly studied options with half the panels removed. With computation this redesign was done in a few days instead of a few weeks using the traditional process. This was the first major project done at Clark Nexsen using computation and this redesign process showed the power of the tool and led to more projects using computation design.

					 <h3>CNC supergraphic numbers</h3>

					 <p>The design team liked the approach of having supergraphic numbers on each floor at the stairs. Computational and non-computatal designs were studied with the team liking the direction of the computational schemes.  Working with the CM, various fabrication methods were studied, eventually landing on CNC ACM panels for their cost and durability. Over 35,000 holes were drilled to create the graphics on the panels. Working with the contractor, we looked at drilling partially or fully through the panels. Studies were completed to determine if the holes went just into the core of the ACM or if they went all the way through the entire panel. The contractor recommended using thru-holes since they could produce it faster and more accurately.

				 <h3>Mirrored Panel Glare Analysis</h3>

				 <p>Unbuilt<br>The design team approached me with a question they couldn't answer. The designers wanted to install reflective metal panels on a pedestrian bridge so that it would become invisible, reflecting the sky and the landscape. However there was concern that the bridge would create hotspots on the surrounding landscape, or even worse be a source of glare for pedestrians on the site, or add glare/heat gain on surrounding buildings. There was no tool to answer this question, so a custom script was created to understand where the hotspots would be at certain times and days. Ultimately the team decided that the times of glare were very limited and proceeded with the scheme.

				 <h3>Skylight geometry design and optimization</h3>

				 <p>Unbuilt<br> The renovation for the alderman library built in 1938 called for putting a skylight in the lightwell to provide more space in the library. The main entrance to the library is up on the third floor overlooking the lightwells. The design team wanted the skylight to be as low as possible so it's not visible outside the windows from the entrance. The design team wanted to contrast the historic building with a modern pillow shaped skylight which also allowed for a low profile to be achieved. Working with the skylight manufacturer, a design was established that met all the requirements such as minimum depth and minimum slope for drainage. The resulting skylight was only 4’ deep and had a soft curving appearance and was well received by the client. Ultimately the skylight was changed to an alternate in the Bid and was not accepted.

				 <h3>Supergraphic</h3>

				 <p>Under Construction<br>
				Part of my job is to teach people how to use computational tools. A project member approached me with an idea to use icons placed on glass to create a supergraphic but didnt know how to accomplish it. Over several multi-hour phone calls, I taught them how to create the design they were after. Eventually they didn't have the time to finish the design, so working with them  I refined it and created the final piece to deliver to the printer. The final design featured 23,745 icons over the 84’ length made up of 21 icons. This design was the result of a VE exercise that removed some 3D casework lettering inside the building. After the supergraphic was complete, several team members said that this was an improvement over the original concept that this replaced.

				 <h3>Facade Refinement</h3>

				 <p>In Design <br>
				 	This  project  is the new main library  in downtown Charlotte where they are replacing the old facility with a new one. The new building focuses on the public as well as new role and responsibilities that libraries have in their communities. As the Architect of Record working with Snohetta, my involvement began in late Design Development. The design concepts are generated by their team and handed off to me to either refine or create new scripts. Refinements are based on code requirements, changes in CD as the products and pricing are refined, etc. In the case of the curved bowl facade, I modified the script to change elevations of horizontal mullions and create new curving horizontal mullion options as part of a VE studies. For the metal panels that are on the curved bowl and also on all other sides of the building, I created a script to study the quantity, pattern, and mix of the 3 metal panel colors. Other scope of work for this project includes geometry coordination between Revit and Rhino where Speckle and Rhino.Inside is used to update the models as needed for the entire design team.

			 	<h5>Dynamo and Grasshopper Deployment</h5>
				 <p>Part of my job is to help create automations for the firm to alleviate pain points. 35 scripts have been deployed to the firm that require no knowledge of Dynamo or Grasshopper.  To date 1,600 scripts have been run modifying 52,000 elements. Usage has doubled year over year  since I started 3 years ago.  Each script run is tracked in the Data Warehouse where I have a PowerBi report to visualize usage. The visualization not only helps drive what scripts are created based on what types of scripts get the most use but also helps understand adoption across the firm. Since the usage is tracked in the data warehouse, automations can be triggered. For example, I receive a Teams notification every time that a script is run which has 2 benefits: If I don't recognize the person's name that has run it, I usually reach out to them and make sure that they are happy with it  and ask if they have any questions. It often leads to a great conversation and increased usage. The second benefit is that  I can tell if a script didn't work properly and send an automated message to the user with a link to the documentation for that script. I also usually reach out to them and check in to see what happened.

				 <p>I was part of the small team responsible for gathering and submitting the data for the AIA2030 Challenge. From this process, I saw the need for us to house our data in a centralized and open platform that everyone could access and created and led a team to accomplish this goal.  Starting in 2018, I regularly meet with the Director of IT and our Database Developer to feed work  to the Database Developer to  develop the concept of the Data Warehouse to hold all our design data. The data is accessible to the entire firm primarily via PowerBI. Over the next 6 years, more and more data from various sources have been added to this warehouse. Eventually it led to the creation of the Project Information Database, a place where staff can enter data into the data warehouse. The primary use of it is around the AIA2030 data and the SE2050 data collection. But it is also displaying data from various sources such as Deltek Vision. The Warehouse is made up of over 100  tables from over a dozen data sources.

Our group took the existing Intranet and pared it down immensely. It became easier to find what was needed as well as an easier place to share knowledge. The result is more engagement across the firm, the information in the libraries is more relevant, staff know where find information, as well as who to contact if things are outdated or missing. Our group is still involved in encouraging people to post and contribute to the Intranet. As a result, the amount of posts, content, and most importantly, the quality have all increased. Our firm was asked to present our redesign to at a conference put on by Knowledge Architecture.</p>

	 			<p>I set out to create a interactive diagram that showed the complexity and relationship of the LEED v4 points. I used a data visualization tool and then packaged it up for the web so that it could be shared.</p>

			 	<h3>CANstruction</h3>
				 <p>I created a Grasshopper script to rapidly visualize and iterate the design for the CANStruction fund raising event. We partnered with RedHat, a tech company, so I wanted to implement as much technology as possible. The script allowed for the form and can heights to be input and it would then generate a visualization of the final result including can count. After the design was completed and sent to the CNC fabricator, the quote was too high because it was slightly wider than the material provided. A quick reduction in the size of the underlying form generated a new output that used 21 less sheets and saved over $1,000 in labor. Without parametric scripting the entire drawings would have had to be redone.</p>
